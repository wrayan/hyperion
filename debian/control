Description: Hyperion is an opensource 'AmbiLight' implementation supported by many devices.
 The main features of Hyperion are:
 * Low CPU load. For a led string of 50 leds the CPU usage will typically be below 1.5% on a non-overclocked Pi.
 * Json interface which allows easy integration into scripts.
 * A command line utility allows easy testing and configuration of the color transforms (Transformation settings are not preserved over a restart at the moment...).
 * Priority channels are not coupled to a specific led data provider which means that a provider can post led data and leave without the need to maintain a connection to Hyperion. This is ideal for a remote application (like our Android app).
 * HyperCon. A tool which helps generate a Hyperion configuration file.
 * Kodi-checker which checks the playing status of Kodi and decides whether or not to capture the screen.
 * Black border detector.
 * A scriptable effect engine.
 * Generic software architecture to support new devices and new algorithms easily.
